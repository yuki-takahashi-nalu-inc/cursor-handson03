# Cursor Curriculum Project Overview and Latest Information

## Project Purpose
Creating a curriculum to master Cursor.
Learning Cursor features while building a simple kanban board (To Do, Doing, Done).

## Key Requirements
- Simple but rich UI (actively utilize external libraries)
- Minimal code, efficient with libraries
- Kanban board, not a Todo app
- No deployment functionality needed
- No advanced features needed
- Include AI code review functionality

## Cursor Latest Information (August 2025 Update)

### Update Background
Updated the entire curriculum based on Cursor's latest features as of August 22, 2025.

### Major Changes

#### 1. Terminology Unification: Composer â†’ Agent
- **Old**: Features called Composer
- **New**: Unified as Agent features

#### 2. Mode Name Changes
- **Agent Mode**: Autonomous execution of complex tasks
- **Ask Mode**: Read-only Q&A mode
- **Custom Mode**: User-defined workflows (Background mode deprecated)

Note: "Normal mode" doesn't exist; Background mode was replaced with Custom mode in 2025

### Key Shortcuts
- Cmd+K (Ctrl+K): Inline editing
- Cmd+L (Ctrl+L): Chat (equivalent to Ask mode)
- Cmd+I (Ctrl+I): Launch Agent (formerly Composer)
- Tab: AI auto-completion

### Notes
- Don't reference old curriculum in sample folders
- Create based on latest Cursor features
- Reflect updates after November 2024

## Curriculum Structure
1. Cursor introduction and project setup
2. Component creation with Tab completion and Cmd+K
3. Complex logic implementation with Chat (Cmd+L)
4. Mastering Agent's three modes
5. Quality improvement with AI code review
6. Practical techniques and troubleshooting

## Implementation Features
- **Practical**: Learn while building a kanban board app
- **Full-stack**: React + Express + SQLite configuration
- **Latest features**: Fully compatible with Cursor features as of August 2025

## SQLite Requirements
- Use SQLite for data persistence
- Implementation using better-sqlite3
- CRUD operations via RESTful API

## Future Update Policy
- Continuously update curriculum with Cursor updates
- Reflect user feedback
- Maintain practical learning experience
